# Pricing FAQs

## Do you provide a free trial?

The free plan that you signup with already allows you to add 2 extra members to your organization. This plan simply contains reduced limits for all our major features.

The paid plans simply provide you with higher limits on same features. For example, the free plan contains role-based access control. And the paid plans simply build over it to let you create custom roles instead of using only the default platform generated ones.

## How will you bill me?

We use a standard pricing model to charge per seat per month. Given stripe's prorated billing, you only pay for what you use. Let's say, you upgraded to the pro plan in the middle of the month, then you will only be charged for the second half of that month in your next bill.

## Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan later?

Yes, absolutely and anytime! If you upgrade or add more units to your plan, your next bill will include the prorated prices from the day you upgraded the plan.

Inverse is true if you downgrade or reduce the units in your plan.

## What if my next monthly payment fails for some reason?

That is okay! We won't automatically delete access of your users from your organization. Our team will politely reach out to you to remind you of the payment before making any irreversible changes to your data.
