  Integrations are essentially just third-party services which can be linked to
  a specific organisation and enable you to perform custom operations on your
  secrets.

# Integrations

For example, a **Github Actions** integration once added to your organisation can allow you to continuously sync secrets everytime you do \`envsecrets set\` to any specific environment of any project in that organisation with your chosen Github repository's actions secrets.

* Integrations are added to organisations.
* Their **events** have to be enabled individually on every environment.

For more information on how to enable events, read this guide: [events.md](events.md "mention").
