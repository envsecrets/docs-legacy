  Also referred to as "sync events" on the platform, events simply allow you to
  enable an organization level integration on a specific environment.

# Events

For example, a **Github Actions** integration once added to your organisation can be enabled on the "dev" or "staging" environment of any project in that organisation to continously sync secrets everytime you do \`envsecrets set\` on that environment with your chosen Github repository's actions secrets.

To enable an event, go to your environment's page on the platform and you should be able to see a tab on left-top corner saying "events."
